Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with

## Git Commit Guidelines

Multiple well-structured commits are preferred over a single squashed commit.

This approach is preferred because:

1. Each commit should represent a single, logical change, making it easier to review and understand
2. Well-structured commits can be reverted individually if necessary,
without breaking working areas of code
3. Cherry-picking specific commits into other branches is much easier and
safer when commits are atomic and meaningful
4. Tools like `git blame` and `git bisect` are more effective
when each commit has a clear purpose and detailed message
5. Helps maintain a Git project that will scale over many years with many contributors

### Required PR Commit Structure

When submitting a pull request, organize your commits as follows:

1. Enable Kconfig controlled options or devicetree related changes
2. Code commits for adding or updating source code, such as drivers or libraries
3. Test code commits for adding or updating tests related to the new or modified code
4. Continuous Integration (CI) changes to update or add workflows or scripts supporting the changes
5. Test image updates
6. Flight software updates

## Git Commit Message Requirements

All contributors must follow the format below:
```
[area]: [subject line]

[commit message body (minimum one line)]

Signed-off-by: Your Full Name <example@email.domain>
```
In the commit message body, all contributors are required to provide detailed explanations
of the changes, including the reasoning and justification behind them.
Well-written commit messages are important for project history and tools like `git blame`,
which help contributors and maintainers understand the origin and reasoning behind specific changes.
Also, note that each line must not exceed 72 characters, and the Git author name and email address
must match those used in the DCO signoff.

Note that `[area]` identifies the area of the code being changed. You can use multiple areas to better describe the context.
If youâ€™re not sure what to use, try running git log `FILE`, where `FILE` is a file you are changing, and using previous commits that changed the same file as inspiration.
Here are some examples of areas.

- `drivers: foo:` for foo driver changes
- `lib: ccsds123b:` for changes to the ccsds123b algorithm in lib
- `doc:` for changes to the documentation

Here is an example of a good commit message.

```
drivers: sensor: abcd1234: fix bus I/O error handling

The abcd1234 sensor driver is failing to check the flags field in
the response packet from the device which signals that an error
occurred. This can lead to reading invalid data from the response
buffer. Fix it by checking the flag and adding an error path.
