# FINCH-FLIGHT-SOFTWARE

## Getting Started

The FINCH-FLIGHT-SOFTWARE officially supports development on the following platforms:
- Ubuntu 24.04 (x86_64)
- macOS (AArch64)
- Windows 11 (x86_64)

Please see [doc/setup.md](doc/setup.md) and [doc/docker.md](doc/docker.md) for development setup instructions using Docker.
If you prefer not to use Docker or would like to manually set up a development environment, see [doc/manual_setup.md](doc/manual_setup.md).

Although not officially supported, you should be able to set up a development environment on other operating systems and architectures, since FINCH-FLIGHT-SOFTWARE is based on Zephyr. You may want to refer to the [Zephyr Project Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/index.html) for details about the required dependencies.
